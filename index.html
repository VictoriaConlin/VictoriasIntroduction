              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>I started my career in the engineering field, working alongside both engineers and machinists to create 3D models and schematic drawings for a manufacturing company. I learned how to work with a wide range of people and to created engineering drawings that were easy to read and clear so that the products that were manufactured were to the specifications that the engineers designed them to be. During this time I was going to school for Electronics Engineering. </p>

                <p>I made the switch from the engineering field to opening uBreakiFix stores with my husband. As we opened our first store we decided that he would continue with his job and I would run the stores. After 3 years we grew to two retail locations and running two remote vans. I managed a team of ten employees across four locations. Were among the top 10% of uBreakiFix franchises, with an employee retention rate of 92%. A few of the biggest things I learned throughout this experience were; I love working on a team, I am great at learning and growing when I get thrown into a challenge, communication is key, and understanding the "why" is always important.

                    The 5 principles we ran our business by:

                    <li>Take care of the customer</li>
                    <li>Take care of each other</li>
                    <li>Do the right thing</li>
                    <li>Think like an owner</li>
                    <li>Have fun along the way</li>

              </div>
              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p> When we got the opportunity to sell our business I started thinking about what I wanted to do for my future career. In all of my experiences I found that I enjoy working on a team and collaborating with others. I was good at figuring out solutions to problems and making "things" do what I want them to do (ie. robots, 3D models, getting a phone to work). I like learning new things and being thrown into a situation and growing from it.  So when someone suggested that I enroll in a codding bootcamp I decided to take on the challenge and try something new.  I loved the experience.  I found that my favorite part of web development was that moment when you conquer a problem and get your project to do what you want. I am very excited to have so many more of those moments in my Web Development career.</p>
